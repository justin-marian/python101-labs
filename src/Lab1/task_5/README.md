# TASK 05

## Requirement

You learned in math the concept of a unit matrix, where all elements on the main diagonal are equal to 1, while the rest are zero.
To strengthen your programming knowledge, you set out to expand the scope of this concept by forming a `zig-zag` matrix, which follows almost the same rules as a unit matrix.

## Note

* Rows = number of lines
* Cols = number of columns
* Rows = Cols (guaranteed)

## Example

```text
input:
10 4

output:

zig_zag_matrix = 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0
1 0 0
1 0 0 0
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1
```

## Run | Testing

For testing, you can run the script directly from the IDE or you can run the command in the terminal:

```bash
./checker.py
```

If you cannot run this script due to permissions, use the following command first:

```bash
sudo chmod 700 checker.py
```
