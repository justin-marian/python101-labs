## 04-anagrams

Given two strings of characters, your task is to identify whether the two strings are anagrams.
An anagram is a word or phrase that is obtained by changing the order of the letters of another word or phrase.
**Warning! Uppercase letters are not identified with lowercase letters, they are distinct, so "LaLa" is not an anagram for "lala". Any type of character is taken into account.**
